# JAVA


Here are some basic concepts in object-oriented Java:

* ## Class: 
  - A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that all objects of the class will have.

* ## Object: 
  - An instance of a class. An object is created from a class and has its own state (values for the attributes) and behavior (methods).

* ## Inheritance:
  - A way for one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

* ## Encapsulation: 
  - The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). This helps to protect the data from being accessed or modified directly by other parts of the program.

* ## Polymorphism:
  - The ability to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. This allows for flexibility in design and easier code maintenance.

* ## Abstraction:
  - abstraction is achieved by creating classes and interfaces that represent higher-level concepts, hiding the complexities and details of the underlying implementation.
  - **Interfaces**
    -  a collection of abstract methods and constants that can be implemented by any class. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance.
