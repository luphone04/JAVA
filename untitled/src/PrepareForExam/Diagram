and aggregation. They display the class name, attributes, and methods, as well as the relationships between classes.

Notation:

Class: Rectangle with class name, attributes, and methods.
Inheritance: Solid line with a hollow arrowhead pointing to the base class.
Composition: Solid line with a filled diamond pointing to the composite class.
Aggregation: Solid line with a hollow diamond pointing to the aggregate class.
Association: Solid line connecting two classes.
Interface:  A dashed line with a hollow arrowhead pointing from the implementing class to the interface.

// Integer.toBinaryString() returnbinary number 1010101 as a String
