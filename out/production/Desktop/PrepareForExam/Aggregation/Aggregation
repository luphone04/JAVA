- Aggregation is a specific type of association that represents a "whole-part" or "has-a" relationship between classes.

-  In aggregation, the whole class (container class) has a reference to the part class (contained class), but the
part class can still exist independently of the whole class. The lifetime of the part class is not tied to the lifetime
of the whole class.

- Aggregation is often used to represent real-world relationships, such as a university and its departments or a c
ar and its engine.

- The key takeaway is that aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship between classes, where the whole class has
a reference to the part class, but the part class can still exist independently.
